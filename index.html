                              The planetary practicioners at Sepher Bahir all
                              have diverse gifts. When we develop conscious
                              relationships with the planets, we can begin to
                              co-create our reality with the help of their
                              influence. The purpose of developing a
                              relationship with them is to gain their favor to
                              enact your Will to your external reality. Think of
                              the planets not only as hunks of rock or gas in
                              the sky, but a vibrational field or
                              multidimensional state of consciousness you can
                              work with to achieve a desired outcome.

              There is a great deal to be learned through the other side of the story these days, Aries. 2020 brought out your more practical and protective side. You were forced to dive so deeply inward, and now you know what you are able to take, and what you can no longer tolerate in your life. 

As you pummel into 2021 with your naturally inquisitive nature, there can be an honest review of where you want to direct the show. This means that you must take authority back in some capacity throughout the year.

Saturn's influence in Aquarius sextiles your sign nicely, giving you a boost of confidence in your career pursuits. This energy can even help you heal some issues around respect and open your mind to new and different methods of leadership. This holds true for you even when a square formed between Saturn in the Water-bearing sign and Uranus in your neighboring sign of Taurus on February 17, June 14, and December 24. There's a direct emphasis on your self-worth during these months as you become more aware of what is best for the greater good. 

You might feel torn at times if you are striving hard and finding strength by following your own direction. If you keep your eye on the prize, you will not leave anyone behind. In fact, you are carving a lesser-known path to lead the way for an entire community. This year, certain lunar eclipses vacillate between Sagittarius and Gemini, activating your personal zones of higher learning and spiritual development, and requiring you to find the words for what you are feeling. 

In 2021, you might have many moments of precognition or feel more in alignment with your intuition, especially surrounding the Sagittarian eclipses, being a May 26 total lunar eclipse and a total solar eclipse on December 4.

              Welcome to a brand-new year ahead of you, Taurus! There's a ton of unpacking you have yet to do, and yet you do not even know where to fully begin. You've been experiencing the lessons of having the planet of chaos charging through your sign with both glimpses in 2018 and moving full-on in 2019. However, this year adds a bit of strife to this energy. 

Uranus does not like constraints under any circumstances, and as Saturn opens the year strongly situated in fellow fixed sign Aquarius, you could find yourself in a continual crossroads. In fact, this is the overall energy of your year. Feeling like you are moving forward and being yanked into place having to wait for changes to take their full effect. You might see through things so much that at times, it might even anger you. This year requires a great deal of maturity and patience on your part. Yes, there can feel like great losses, mainly not through your own undoing, but through the continual clash between Saturn in the Water-bearing Aquarius and outer-body Uranus in your sign.

The year's lunar cycles are eye-opening in your personal zones of self-acceptance and spiritual growth. The May 26 total lunar eclipse in Sagittarius does shed light on those areas of your life that you've tried to sweep under the rug. Understand that eclipses are galvanizing energy that truly wants you to get real with yourself so that you may heal from this situation. The annual solar eclipse in Gemini on June 10 can add some clarity to your overall financial destiny—also reflected with a partial lunar eclipse in your sign of the Bull on November 19. Then luckily, you'll feel the weight off your shoulders on December 4 as the total solar eclipse sees you revisiting certain events and scenarios around your karmic connections, this time with a renewed sense of self.

              There’s for sure plenty to talk about this year, Gemini! 2021 is a highly stimulating year for your creative sign. You are able to feel more aligned with your highest good, and can even make some pretty fantastic new friends along the way. You might actually be the go-to person when things get a little rocky, mainly because you adjust so easily and quickly to things and are able to see the humor in almost any situation. 

As the year begins with some confrontational squares between Jupiter in Aquarius and Uranus in Taurus, you'll get a beneficial wave of abundance headed your way even through some gritty energy. This is also true in mid-February, May, and late December for you as Saturn's transit through Aquarius squares Uranus in Taurus, causing some chaotic waves in the world.

This can be tough on others through much of the year; but because Saturn will be nicely angled towards your airy sign, it will be bringing you many insights and brilliant moments. This can be that time where you find yourself in a very powerful way. Expect the unexpected and be extremely grateful for the gifts you receive, because you deserve them! 

One important piece of the 2021 puzzle is to really consider the transition period of your birthday months. You might be a little caught up during this year's Mercury retrograde cycles, which all take place in air signs. One of the most important for you occurs on May 29, following a transformative total lunar eclipse in your opposing sign of Sagittarius. This is a vibe that will definitely have you rethinking a lot of different pieces of the story. And although it can be a highly enlightening time when it comes to all aspects of your life, there is still much work to be done through the summer. Especially because you are also met with an annular solar eclipse on June 10—at the same time Mercury continues a tricky retrograde cycle in your sign until June 22.

You made some incredible changes during 2020 and are making some real headway. There were many ups and downs that could have felt a little more traumatic than normal, especially for your compassionate sign of the Crab. 

This year really serves as looking at your life from an outsider's perspective. You're able to take an observer’s perspective and might even consider diving into some deep self-reflection that you once shied away from. Working in several facets of spirituality, body care, research, and expanding your mind, in general, is what 2021 is all about. There is nothing too out-of-the-ordinary for you right now, as you might even be more interested in either paranormal or occult-type studies.

You are extremely tied to the cycles of the moon, who's nodes now cycle between Gemini in the north position and Sagittarius in the south position. You are working out karmic cycles through learning your own patterns in communication and understanding what stories you've been told for far too long. You might even be faced with the truth about a family situation that you once spent far too much time trying to resolve. Maybe you've sacrificed your own happiness for the good of your loved ones only to come to terms with what you really want for yourself. 

This is a year where you can really step into your own independence and gain a little emotional space from the judgments of others. There's a refreshing tone to your life once you accept the truth about something you've been stuffing under the rug. 2021, in general, is a time for you to face the music, and see how special you really are! Stop being so hard on yourself, loving Cancer!

              six-month retrograde cycle, you've gotten an idea of where you are

              these two outer-bodies, this is going to be an exponential lesson
              for you. There is a strong connection to time itself these days.
              You might feel throughout the year that time is either moving
              extremely fast or slowed down to a glacial pace. The most pointed
              squares being present on February 14, June 14, and December 24

              the universe has in store! It is truly a time to ask your spirit

              As Saturn briefly entered your sign in 2020 experiencing a
              six-month retrograde cycle, you've gotten an idea of where you are
              headed this year. The structured planet is now transiting through
              your eccentric sign that enjoys the unknown twists and turns that
              bring forward many surprises and adventures. The year is marked by
              some intense squares between Saturn in your sign and Uranus in the
              fellow fixed sign of Taurus. Because you are co-ruled by both of
              these two outer-bodies, this is going to be an exponential lesson
              for you. There is a strong connection to time itself these days.
              You might feel throughout the year that time is either moving
              extremely fast or slowed down to a glacial pace. The most pointed
              squares being present on February 14, June 14, and December 24
              will really test your sense of time in general. The entire purpose
              of this energy is to align you with your spiritual awareness and
              allow you to make decisions from your sense of intuitive
              awareness.

              There's a difficult energy to pin down this year, Pisces. You have to really take the approach of allowing life to come as it is for your sensitive sign of the Fish. 

The most pivotal transit affecting your chart includes a series of eclipses between Gemini and Sagittarius that activate your personal tenth and fourth houses. These are more specifically your zones of career pursuits and family development. Whenever you feel like you are getting out-of-control this year, one strategy to take that will really help you is to always follow your grounded path.

As Uranus continues to break boundaries in Taurus, this outer planet is also met with a conflicting square with Saturn in Aquarius. This holds the element of extremes, especially in mid-February, mid-June, and late December; but sparks certain events that also affect your loving sign throughout the entirety of the year. 

Yes, this energy will challenge you on many levels, especially through your personal realms of communication and psychic development. For those Pisces who are open to their gifts, this will be extremely easy for you, and for those who have suppressed your personal intuitive nature, this can feel a little overwhelming at times. 

You are extremely in tune with the unseen world this year, and it can feel like you're able to predict things before they even happen! It is a good year to work with others that support you, and also share your gifts as well. During this fascinating year, your spiritual life might even deepen.
